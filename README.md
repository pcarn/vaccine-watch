# Vaccine Watch
Bot to notify when vaccine appointments are available.

Supports checking Hy-Vee, and sending notifications to Slack, Discord, and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kcvaccinewatch).

Notifications are sent when a location has appointments. No more notifications are sent for that location until it becomes unavailable again.

PRs welcome to support other clinics or notification methods.

This project has no affiliation with any of the clinics mentioned.
